Learning ASP.NET this is just a simple rest API that I built, it uses a local db file.

The endpoints are:

GET all games
http://localhost:xxxx/games

GET game by id
http://localhost:xxxx/games/{id}

POST game
http://localhost:xxxx/games

PUT game by id
http://localhost:xxxx/games/{id}

DELETE game by id
http://localhost:xxxx/games/{id}

GET all genres

http://localhost:xxxx/genres
